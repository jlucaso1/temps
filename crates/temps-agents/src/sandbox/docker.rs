#  2. Codex itself ships as a Node script (`#!/usr/bin/env node`), which

/// the control-plane API (typically 172.x.x.1 or 10.x.x.1 on the bridge),
/// the PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB port, and cloud-metadata endpoints
/// (169.254.169.254).  This function installs a dedicated iptables chain
/// `TEMPS_SANDBOX_EGRESS` and hooks it into the FORWARD chain on the bridge
/// interface, dropping traffic to the five private ranges while leaving all
/// public-internet egress (npm, pip, cargo, GitHub, …) unrestricted.
///
/// # Platform behaviour
///
/// - **Linux** (production): full iptables filtering applied.
/// - **macOS / non-Linux** (developer laptops): the function logs a warning
///   and returns immediately without error.  Docker Desktop on macOS handles
///   networking inside a VM where host iptables are irrelevant.
///
/// # Permissions
///
/// The temps server process needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to manipulate iptables.  If
/// the iptables command exits with a permission error the function logs a
/// `WARN` with an actionable message and continues — sandbox creation is NOT
/// aborted.  This keeps the server functional on constrained environments
/// (rootless Docker, unprivileged containers) at the cost of the egress filter
/// being inactive.
///
/// # Idempotency
///
/// The function flushes and recreates the `TEMPS_SANDBOX_EGRESS` chain on
/// every call and uses `-D` before `-I` for the FORWARD hook, so running on
/// every server start is safe and never accumulates duplicate rules.
